Mixed Messages Project:
Build a message generator program - Each time a user runs a program they should get a new randomized output; The outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

My version:
1. Give a simple fortune (example: "Today is looking: {randomized word}")
2. Provide an inspirational message (example: "Here's some advice: {phrase/proverb}")
3. Suggest an activity (example: "Maybe try: {activity})

To keep the codebase of the main app.js clean, leave the arrays filled with random text in a separate phrases file and export them from there.

After programming the above and confirming no errors commit and proceed to next step in a new branch

My website:
1. Create a simply styled webpage that displays the above message in the middle
-Styling
-Fortune will only style the randomized word which will have a color/font associated with each result, this will -all be on one line
-Inspirational message will contain "Here's some advice" on one line and on the next line the phrase/proverb -will be italicized
-Activity will only style the randomized activity with bold text, this will all be on one line
-Commit after the website displays the above properly to the website branch
2. Create a simply styled button that can refresh the message and provide a new outcome
3. Create a simply styled button that will copy the randomized message as plain text to the clipboard
-After confirming the buttons work without error final commit

Once the website is confirmed to be functional, triple check for bugs in both the original code functionality and the newly introduced buttons before merging the branch into main, and then delete the website branch
