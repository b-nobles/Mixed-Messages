# Today's Message

This is a program with an outlined goal of providing the user with a randomized message! 

## How to use
### Method 1
1. Download all files
2. Host locally using the index.html
This method provides a mock website containing the message with a reset function

### Method 2
1. Download message app.js
2. Run message app.js
3. The message output will be done in the console
This method does not require local hosting and will provide a similarly structured message

## How it works
The program selects a random word or phrase from three different arrays and then plugs those values into a function that returns a message that can be read by the user.
