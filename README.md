# Today's Message

This is a program with an outlined goal of providing the user with a randomized message! 

## How to use
### Method 1
1. Download files
2. Host the index.html locally to view
This will allow you to view the information as a simple website 

### Method 2
1. Download files
2. Open index.html in an internet browser
3. Open internet browser's console to view message
This method doesn't require hosting the website locally but the webpage itself won't have the fields filled in

## How it works
The program selects a random word or phrase from three different arrays and then plugs those values into a function that returns a message that can be read by the user. The Reset button will provide a new message.
