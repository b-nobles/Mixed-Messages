# Today's Message

This is a program with an outlined goal of providing the user with a randomized message! 

## How to use
1. Open up the webpage
2. If you would like another message press 'New Message'
3. If you like the message, press 'Copy" to copy the message to your clipboard

## How it works
The program selects a random word or phrase from three different arrays and then plugs those values into a function that returns a message that can be read by the user.
