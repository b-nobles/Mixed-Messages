# Today's Message

This is a program with an outlined goal of providing the user with a randomized message! 

## How to use
### Method 1
1. Download all files
2. Host locally using the index.html
This method provides a simple web page containing the message with a reset function

### Method 2
1. Download One Page Version folder
2. Run index.html in an internet browser
This method provides a simple web page containing the message with a reset function, however it does not use module functionality so it does not need to be hosted locally to be viewed properly

## How it works
The program selects a random word or phrase from three different arrays and then plugs those values into a function that returns a message that can be read by the user. The Reset button will provide a new message.
